## Practical Exercise 1.1

**Objective**: Understand the MCP ecosystem and architecture

### Instructions

1. Visit the [Model Context Protocol website](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)
2. Explore the official documentation
3. Make a list of 5 different use cases for MCP
4. Compare MCP with a traditional API integration approach for one of these use cases

### Expected Outcome

Create a document with:
- 5 potential use cases for MCP
- A comparison table showing how the same integration would be implemented with traditional APIs versus MCP
- Notes on the advantages and disadvantages of each approach

## Recommended Reading

1. [MCP Specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/)
   - Focus on the introduction and overview sections
   - Pay attention to the high-level architecture

2. [Introduction to Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)
   - Study the diagrams showing the client-server model
   - Note the different components and their relationships

3. Article: "What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?"
   - Context for MCP's rapid adoption
   - Industry perspective on the protocol's significance

## Self-Assessment Questions

Test your understanding by answering these questions:

1. What problem does MCP aim to solve in the AI ecosystem?
2. How does MCP differ from traditional API integration methods?
3. What is the "M×N problem" and how does MCP address it?
4. What protocol did MCP draw inspiration from?
5. Name three major companies that have adopted MCP.
6. What are the three primary capability types in MCP?
7. How would you explain the benefits of MCP to a non-technical manager?
8. What types of applications would benefit most from MCP integration?

## Reflection Activity

Consider and write brief responses to these questions:

1. How might MCP change the way AI systems are developed and integrated?
2. What industries or applications do you think would benefit most from MCP?
3. What challenges might arise when adopting MCP in an existing system?
4. How does MCP fit into the broader AI ecosystem and development practices?
