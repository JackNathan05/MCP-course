## Practical Exercise 1.2

**Objective**: Visualize the MCP architecture

### Instructions

1. Create a diagram showing the MCP components and their relationships
   - Include MCP Hosts, Clients, Servers, and Data Sources
   - Show the communication flows between components
   - Indicate where capabilities (Tools, Resources, Prompts) fit in

2. Map out the communication flow between these components
   - Initialization
   - Discovery
   - Context Provision
   - Invocation
   - Execution

3. Identify where authentication and security checks occur in this flow

4. Consider how error handling might be implemented
   - What types of errors might occur?
   - How should they be communicated back to the client?
   - How should the host application present errors to the user?

### Expected Outcome

A comprehensive diagram with annotations explaining the components and their interactions, plus notes on security checkpoints and error handling strategies.

## Recommended Reading

1. [MCP Specification - Protocol Flow](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/)
   - Focus on the sections covering message exchange patterns
   - Study the sequence diagrams for different interactions

2. [MCP Architecture Overview](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)
   - Pay particular attention to the transport mechanisms
   - Note how different components relate to each other

3. [Security Considerations for MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/guides/security/)
   - Authentication mechanisms
   - Authorization patterns
   - Data protection strategies

## Self-Assessment Questions

Test your understanding by answering these questions:

1. What are the three main capability types in MCP?
2. Describe the role of MCP Clients versus MCP Servers.
3. What happens during the "Discovery" phase of MCP communication?
4. How does MCP handle version compatibility?
5. What are the main transport mechanisms supported by MCP?
6. How does the MCP Host interact with AI models?
7. Why is the distinction between Tools and Resources important?
8. What security considerations are most critical for MCP implementations?

## Practical Implementation Exercise

**Objective**: Experiment with MCP architecture concepts using pseudocode

Create pseudocode for:

1. A simple MCP Client that connects to a server and discovers capabilities
```
function connectToServer(serverUrl):
    // Establish connection
    // Perform version negotiation
    // Discover capabilities
    // Return client instance
```

2. A basic MCP Server that exposes one tool and one resource
```
function createServer():
    // Initialize server
    // Register tool
    // Register resource
    // Start listening for connections
```

3. A Host application that uses the client to invoke a tool
```
function useToolWithModel(client, userQuery, model):
    // Send query to model with tool descriptions
    // Check if model wants to use a tool
    // If yes, invoke the tool via client
    // Return result to model
```
