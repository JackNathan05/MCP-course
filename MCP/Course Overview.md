## Course Description

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) course is a comprehensive program designed to teach you how to use this powerful open standard for connecting AI models with external data sources and tools. By the end of this course, you'll be able to build both MCP servers and clients, integrate them with AI models, and create robust applications that leverage the full potential of MCP.

## What You'll Learn

- The fundamental concepts and architecture of Model Context Protocol
- How to build and deploy MCP servers with various capabilities
- How to develop MCP clients that connect to servers and AI models
- Integration patterns for different use cases (IDEs, enterprise systems, productivity apps)
- Advanced topics including security, performance optimization, and multi-server environments
- How to build a complete MCP-based application as a capstone project

## Course Structure

### Unit 1: Fundamentals of Model Context Protocol
An introduction to MCP, its architecture, and core concepts. You'll learn what MCP is, why it was developed, and how it compares to other integration protocols.

### Unit 2: Building MCP Servers
Focused on creating MCP servers that expose capabilities to clients. You'll learn how to set up servers, implement tools and resources, and secure your implementations.

### Unit 3: Developing MCP Clients
Covers the development of MCP clients that connect to servers and AI models. You'll learn how to discover capabilities, integrate with AI models, and create effective user experiences.

### Unit 4: MCP Integration Case Studies
Explores real-world applications of MCP in different domains, including development environments, enterprise knowledge management, and productivity applications.

### Unit 5: Advanced MCP Topics
Dives into more complex aspects of MCP, including managing multiple servers, optimizing performance, implementing security best practices, and building an MCP ecosystem.

### Unit 6: Capstone Project
A hands-on project where you'll apply everything you've learned to build a complete MCP-based application. You'll design, implement, test, and document your project.

By completing this course, you'll gain the knowledge and skills to leverage MCP effectively in your own AI applications, contributing to the growing ecosystem of AI tools and services that use this open standard.
